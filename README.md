# Sentence-level Sentiment Classification

**My implementation of Tsinghua University's Deep Learning Summer School Individual Lab**


Given a natural language text, sentiment was classified with five-class sentiment labels:

- 0 (very negative)
- 1 (negative)
- 2 (neutral)
- 3 (positive)
- 4 (very positive)

GRU, LSTM and self-attention mechanism were used and compared.
